HTML CSS GIT CHALLENGE

AS A  marketing agency 
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standars

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

Heading attributes fall in sequential order

Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
